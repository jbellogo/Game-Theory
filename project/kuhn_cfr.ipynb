    "## The Game\n",
    "\n",
    "[Kuhn Poker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuhn_poker) is a two player\n",
    "3-card betting game.\n",
    "The players are dealt one card each out of Ace, King and Queen (no suits).\n",
    "There are only three cards in the pack so one card is left out.\n",
    "Ace beats King and Queen and King beats Queen - just like in normal ranking of cards.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both players ante $S$ chips (blindly bet $S$ chips).\n",
    "After looking at the cards,\n",
    "the first player can either pass or bet $1$ chip.\n",
    "* If first player passes, the the player with higher card wins the pot.\n",
    "* If first player bets, the second play can bet (i.e. call) $1$ chip or pass (i.e. fold).\n",
    "    * If the second player bets and the  player with the higher card wins the pot.\n",
    "    * If the second player passes (i.e. folds) the first player gets the pot.\n",
    "\n",
    "This game is played repeatedly and a good strategy will optimize for the\n",
    "long term utility (or winnings).\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's some example games:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `KAp` - Player 1 gets *K*. Player 2 gets *A*. Player 1 passes. Player 2 doesn't get a betting chance and Player 2 wins the pot of $2S$ chips.\n",
    "* `QKbp` - Player 1 gets *Q*. Player 2 gets *K*. Player 1 bets a chip. Player 2 passes (folds). Player 1 gets the pot of $2S+1$ because Player 2 folded.\n",
    "* `QAbb` - Player 1 gets *Q*. Player 2 gets *A*. Player 1 bets a chip. Player 2 also bets (calls). Player 2 wins the pot of $2S+2$."
